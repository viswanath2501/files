                       DOCKER
Docker is a Containerisation Tool
In Docker we build Containers
With the help of Docker File we create Images , and with the help of Image we create containers
In containers we run the Applications
Docker image is created with Docker file or Docker hub
Dcker hub is used to store images for future purpose


1.For creating a container with the help of Image we use the command
      docker run -itd --name -p imageid
  we can create "N" number of containers wth one image

2.To see How many containers are running we use the command
                 docker ps

3.If we want to see all the containers that are Stopped and Running , we use command
                 docker ps-a

4.If we want to see Docker Images we use the command
                 docker images

5.Docker containers is one kind of firewall (data stored in the form og Image), Data will be more secured

6.To install Docker
       apt -get install docker.io

7.For changing the Hostname ( i.e Ip address)
       hostnamectl set-hostname docker

8.command to build Docker image from Docker file
       dockerbuild.   (. is nothing but current path)

9.For giving image name 
       docker build -t imagename

10.for pushing the image to docker hub for future purpose 
       docker login
       username:-
       password:-

11.command to push image to dockerhub
       docker push imageid

12.for seeing all volumes
        docker volume ls

13. To create a volume
        docker volume create name

14.Docker volumes - To retrieve the information of Deleted container when we Terminate, which was saved in Docker volume

15. Docker execute command is used to Login into the container
          docker exec -it containerid /bin/bash

16.For docker home directory
          cd/var/lib/docker

17.To remove or delete a container 
          docker rm-f containerid

18.To retrieve the Deleted container data we use the command
          docker run -itd --name -p -v :/data imageid

19.Docker networks -
   In docker networks , we can see IP addresses of containers
          docker network ls

20. To create new network
          docker inspect network bridge
       it lists containers Ip addresses

21. To create own network
          docker network create --driver bridge networkname

22.Docker file components

   3.copy
   4.Add
   5.Expose
   6.Workdir
   7.Env
   8.Cmd
